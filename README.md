# **Joseph Ackroyd WDC fullstack test**

A few notes.

- Background image is responsice - is in correct position when window is same size as the given PDF image.

- In the Header component I flipped the whole thing to reverse the image, and then reversed all the other content. I also positioned the background with CSS. This was quite time consuming - I think I would usually just flip and crop it in photoshop.

- I wanted to do the form and add validation, but didn't have time. I would have used Formik and Yup, as I did here - https://github.com/apoteka1/nc-readcycle/blob/main/screens/SignUpScreen.js
